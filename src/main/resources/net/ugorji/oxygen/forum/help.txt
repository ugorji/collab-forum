=== Introduction
Oxygen Forum was written because of a lack of Forum Engines which
* Leveraged the J2EE Web Container features like 
  * Data Sources
* Could be dropped in as a portlet
* Uses the database for its primary use ie storing data
  * ~~ Not for searching, etc ~~
* Allows a pluggable way of handling groups, users, etc
  * ~~ Most only allowed you to store users/groups/permissions in the database ~~

=== Installation

The oxyforum distribution is pre-configured for a seamless installation. To do this:
 # Download the distribution (oxyforum.war OR oxyforum-no-lib-jars.zip). This contains
   * README.txt (this file)
   * Contents of the web application 
   * ~~ If oxyforum.war, it also contains all dependent lib jars in WEB-INF/lib/ ~~
 # Unzip it into a directory
 # ~~ If you downloaded oxyforum.war, skip this step. ~~ \\ \
   Download the third party jars which oxyforum depends on. Put them in the WEB-INF/lib directory \
   after unzipping the zip archive, or on the classpath of your server (so it can be shared with other applications). These are
   * Mandatory
