Port phpbb2 to java
===================
General notes
- no admin screens (let users edit the config file directly)
- use jsf. it means SEF will not be there ... but thatz ok.
- use wiki syntax (no bbcode)
- seperate registration from the forum
  - there is a different authentication and authorization module section.
    - user belongs to what group/roles, etc etc etc
  - emoticons are in a special directory (or base prefix)
    - they cannot be uploaded (just installable from the main place)
- everything security is stored outside the DB
  - e.g. access control, user passwords, etc etc etc
- *** Try to maintain the same DB schema as phpBB ***
  - most likely, this will not be fully possible
- no polls supported

post message to forum
- delete, create, edit
- email notification of replies to your post
- subscribe to a topic
- Original emoticons to portray emotions
post private message
- delete, create, edit
- 2 folders: inbox, sent
forums
- in a tree structure
- each forum has a parent
- some forums may be restricted to certain groups
  (stored outside the DB, like in a configuration file)
search
- leverage lucene. for powerful searching
Security
- not stored in DB
- Powerful forum, user and group permission management
  - control access to viewing, posting, replying, etc
  - control access to forums only to specific groups
- Ban usernames, IP addresses/hostnames
- IP tracking of posts and posters
- mass email 
User personalization
- local, remote and uploadable avatars
Moderation Features
- Topic editing
- Mass delete/move/lock/unlock of posts
- Topic splitting
- Option of auto-pruning of old or unanswered messages on a per-forum basis
Administration Centre
- Forum setup
- Word censoring
- Emoticon setup
- IP tracking of posts and posters
Style and Customisation
- Allow ability for different forums to have different looks??? No.

Tables
======

----------------------------------------

---- Forum setup
# Need to do. But skip phpbb_categories (instead, use a tree of forums, so no categories)
# also, add prune_days to phpbb_forums (so we don't need a different table)
phpbb_forums
---- Postings
# Need to do.
# Merge phpbb_posts_text into phpbb_posts, and same for privmsgs
phpbb_posts
---- statistics
# Need to do. 
phpbb_topics (stores info about a topic, and some statistics)
phpbb_users  (stores user preferences, and some statistics)

----------------------------------------

---- Private Messaging
# Skip. Profile holds email address. We can give a form to hide this, but internally post the email to the person.
# We would leverage FCKEditor for this (to send an HTML message).
phpbb_privmsgs

---- Auth
# Handle it in Preferences Module.
phpbb_auth_access
phpbb_user_group
phpbb_groups
phpbb_banlist
phpbb_users
phpbb_ranks
---- Configuration
# Handle it using a flat file
phpbb_config
---- Notification
# Skip. Handle it using preferences module. Implement a listener (which can respond to events).
phpbb_topics_watch
---- Smilies
# Skip. Handle it within wikiparser.
phpbb_smilies
---- Themes and Templates
# Skip. Handle it using JSF Facelets.
phpbb_themes
phpbb_themes_name
---- Voting
# Skip. Do not support voting.
phpbb_vote_desc
phpbb_vote_results
phpbb_vote_voters
---- Search
# Skip. Handle using Lucene.
phpbb_search_results
phpbb_search_wordlist
phpbb_search_wordmatch
---- Bad words and Replacements
# Skip. Handle using a flat file.
# flat file stores words and replacements
# Wiki Parser should use this internally ... (within the do_word function).
phpbb_words
---- Session Management
# Skip. Let Webapp handle it.
phpbb_confirm
phpbb_disallow
phpbb_sessions
---- Not needed
phpbb_categories (do not use)
phpbb_posts_text (do not use)
phpbb_privmsgs_text (do not use)

----------------------------------------

== Strategy


The forum will be developed using the following technologies:
- Hibernate (ORM)
- Lucene (indexing and searching)
- FreeMarker (templating where required)

Security
- Use a Servlet Filter
  - put the ForumEngine into the threadlocal
  - put a Subject into the threadlocal, which has getRemoteUser and the roles that user has
  - *** we need to configure the relevant roles ***

Domain Objects:
  - ForumConfig()
  - ForumDAO(ForumConfig)
    - holds a reference to SessionFactory
    - all CRUD methods are here
      - deleteForum, addForum, updateForum, addTopic, addPost, ...
      - users only use this from here
  - ForumIndexingManager(ForumConfig)
  - ForumEngine()
    - this is a singleton. This is ok, since it's a webapp.
    - get it by doing ForumEngine.getForumEngine()
    - at startup, we index the whole thing (listener does)
      - there is a link to re-index.
      - while indexing is running, 
Data Objects
  - Forum, Topic, Post


Use Cases / Specifications
- Allow user define skin/template
- Allow base properties, and allow user override the config directory
- Allow a runtime directory, which holds
  - user, password, group files
  - preferences
  - indexes (for searching)
- The following use-cases
  - **** All these are exposed through one single Spring Bean ****
  - **** This is the ForumEngine class ****
  - addForum (add a forum, update the index, etc)
  - updateForum
  - deleteForum
  - addTopic
  - addPost
  - editPost
  - getPost
  - getTopic
  - getForum

To use cases will demand the following actions:
ForumViewAction     admin.html          admin            
ManageForumsAction  manageforums.html   manageforums    id(from ViewCtx)
ForumViewAction     forums.html         forums          id(from ViewCtx)
ForumViewAction     forum.html          forum           id(from ViewCtx)
EditForumFormAction editforumform.html  editforumform   id(from ViewCtx)

DeleteForumAction   -                   deleteforum     id(from ViewCtx)
EditForumAction     -                   editforum       params: forumid, ...

ViewTopicAction     topic.html          topic           id(from ViewCtx)
PostFormAction      postform.html       postform        params: forumid, topicid, postid 
                                                        (for createTopic, createPost, editPost respectively)

PostAction          -                   post            params: forumid, topicid, postid 
                                                        (for createTopic, createPost, editPost respectively)


ForumViewAction     searchform.html     searchform      
SearchResultsAction searchresults.html  searchresults   
CreateIndexAction   -                   createindex           

Each action should put in the ViewContext, what the current ForumId is.
E.g. ViewTopicAction gets the id of the topic, so should store what the 

ViewContext
- action
- id (extracted from request parameter: id or from path - the primary id)
- RequestParameters

----

Use straightforward forum.
- no jsf, no spring, no thing ...
- just use hibernate, freemarker, lucene, ...
- use the homegrown MVC framework - so we can control the URL's et al
  - action, 

Pages are stored under 
  src/net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/html/*.html
Properties are stored under
  src/net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/init.properties

persistence directory
- everything else lives under there

There is a single config file ... so no need for a config directory.
- config file will reference the location of the runtime directory???

Key design:
- no need for a listener in the code
- indexing happens explicitly (via admin)
- so all resources are found via ClassLoader.getResource(...)
- 

To do:
- searching / indexing
  - this is an admin function 
    (reindex all, index last changes in X # days, etc)
- recent topics
- etc ...


To start
========
- Create the mysql.sql file
- run it on your database
- use the hibernate eclipse plugin to reverse-engineer and generate 
  - POJO classes
  - hibernate config file
  - hibernate mapping file
- make classes to do the other things

package: net.ugorji.oxygen.forum.view
- backing beans, et al for the UI's

JSF pages:
- list forums
- show forum (list topics for a forum)
  - supports paging
- view topic (show posts for a topic)
  - supports paging
- reply to post
  - create new topic (means reply to post with ID = -1)

                  (if topicId is -1, then we're creating a new topic)
                  (else if postId is -1, then we're replying to a topic)

ForumConstants
- 
ForumUtils.java
# full of static methods
# should only be called within the context of a request
  - at which point, we've had a chance to stuff the ForumEngine into the threadlocal
  - utilize the lifecycle of JSF to your benefits
    - in your backing bean, during the apply request phase, U can check the values, and 
      check authentication, and throw an exception if anything is wrong
    - then declare an error page to handle that exception appropriately
Methods
- getForumEngine()
- setForumEngine(ForumEngine f)
- getSessionFactory() - returns a static variable already stored
- getCurrentSession() 
- closeCurrentSession()

ForumEngine() implements Closeable 
- close()
- reload()
- getForumConfig()
- getUserPreferencesManager()
- getAuthenticationManager()
- getAuthorizationManager()
ForumConfig()
- get(String key)
- set(String key, String value)
- getConfigDirectory
- getRuntimeDirectory

ForumWebappListener()
- stores the forum engine in the ServletContext

Dependencies
============
PicoContainer and NanoContainer (for the dependency injection)
- do not use anymore. There are not enough components to warrant this.
JSF + Facelets (for the pages and templating)
Hibernate (for DB persistence)
- this introduces its own dependencies
lucene (for search only. no indexing for other reasons.)

Use a servletFilter to do auth.
Use a sessionListener to do counts, of how many folks have connected et al.

Note
====
- only members can post.
  - so U have to be logged in to post, and U have to be a member to log in.

Thinking of the view
- should we look like theserverside.com, or like phpbb
  - theserverside.com does not do avatars et al, phpbb does
  - tss.com shows threaded view. phpbb shows chronological view.

Profile information
===================
User profile information is stored outside the app.

The UserProfileManager client is used to access the user profile.

Making changes to it may happen within the app

The profile info for phpbb includes:
- signature
- YIM
- Timezone
- Preferred Locale
- Publicize Email?
- Attach Signature To Posts?
- Show If I'm Logged In?
- Avatar (any arbitrary URL ...)

Templates
=========
Each forum can have its own template.
This is a configuration thing.

Uploads
===========
Folks can upload arbitrary files.
This will allow attachments, and avatars, to be supported.

Folks have to be logged in, to upload files.

These files are stored on the file system, in a place which is 
viewable online.

Admin configures a 
- upload dir=/a/b/uploads/
- upload baseurl = /uploads/

Uploaded files go to:
- $upload_dir/users/$username/$avatar_image

When nobody is logged in
========================

Configure who the default (anonymous) user is.
- in fact, make this non-configurable - call him guest (let that name be restricted).

He should *NOT* have an entry in the user password manager, and in the user database.

To Do
=====
set 
  unsaved-value="null"
for each id column.

How do U know who the moderators for a given forum are???
- based on roles
  - moderators for a given forum, have roles assigned to them.
    - ie U say. To moderate forum1, U must be in the role forum1_moderator
- So there must be a servlet filter that enforces security on the forum
  - for portlets, we'd have to do it a slightly different way.
    - maybe use delegation???

# request parameters are used for everything in the forum
  - f = forum id
  - t = topic id
  - p = post id
  - u = user id (this is not necessary)
  Other parameters have special keys (try to make them single digits)

======

Let phpbb2 also use an init.properties, and then a oxyforum.properties file
- like in wiki

There's a context param which could override
- config directory
- runtime directory

this will allow the config directory and runtime directory to live 
outside of the webapp, allowing 
- easier use as a portlet 
- easier updates to the webapp (clean out directory and refresh)
(like in wiki)

(done)
======

When you do a search
- search on topic title, or on whole topic posts, or on posts
  - index each post individually
  - index each topic altogether
  - index each topic 
    - store title, author
- show the following info on the page
  Topic, Topic Author, Forum, #Replies, #Views, Last Post date
- search for the thread (topic) which has the 

Use xdoclet to do the hibernate stuff.
- this way, I only maintain the classes myself.

let encrypted password really encrypt the password.

Integrate jcaptha

====

xdoclet

- use xdoclet
- compare the output to what is in /tmp/oxyforum
- call the files 
  Forum, Topic, Post, User

====

We need to leverage exadel project, so that we can test well.

To do this, copy all the .* files to /tmp/oxyforum.10_22/ (for backup).
Then make changes, so that the .* files look like the ones from a 
brand new exadel project.

in .exadelproject,
  look for WEB-ROOT, WebContent, JavaSource

====

Add all eclipse files in each project, to cvs ...

====

JSF 1.1, Unified EL, Facelets will give me all I want.
- then I can use c:forEach
- and do not use tomahawk


====

what is the type for date?
add velocity to forum


====

Problems:
- Facelets does not work well with forms
  - it exits rendering once the form is completed.
  - if U need command links in your overall template, you are hosed
    - since they have to be put in a form
    - and once U do so, other forms in a client file will not work well
  - and if U do not put <h:form> in your template, nothing works 
  - so to fix, use h:outputLink in your template only, and then put 
    h:form in all your pages

Myfaces wants all your bundles to be loaded from the actual 
file (not from template.xhtml).

Somehow, the template is cleared when a new page is being loaded.
- so facelets is not working.

For now, use a template which does not require a form
- ie U can't use commandLinks in the template.xhtml

====



we may hit DB in the following phases
- apply request values (due to conversion)
- Process validation
- Update model values
- Invoke application

So, we really want to do this:
- since we can stop at any phase
- closeSession at the end of each phase (if one was created)
  getCurrentSession(...) will
    - openSession
    - beginTransaction
  closeCurrentSession(...) will
    - commit transaction
    - close session
- all phases are coded to call closeCurrentSession(...) afterPhase


====

all action events do this:
- parse parameters.
  first parse postid, then topic id, then forumid, then parent forum id
  - sets all the ones it can set

all forms below act on a Temp forum or Post in memory

prepareEditForum
- parseParameters
- set the temp forum as the persistent forum object

prepareEditPost
- parseParameters
- set the temp post as the persistent post object

createOrModifyForum
- parseParameters
- take the temp forum
- if forumid is set, then we need to modify the forum
- else we're creating a new one

createPostWithTopicIfNecessary
- parseParameters
- take the temp post
- if postid is set, then modify the persisted post
- if topicid is set, then create a new reply
- if forumid is set, then create a topic, and then the post

parseParameters
links
- have their own actions to just parseParameters
  (and thus set things in the backing bean)

# no need for these ones ... 
prepareCreateForum
- parseParameters

prepareReply
- parseParameters

prepareCreateTopic
- parseParameters

To edit a forum
- click page
  - this will load up the tempforum

===============

I couldn't get inputhidden to work, and cause 
my model to be updated with its values.

So I have to resort to *not using commandButton* and only
use commandLink. Luckily, commandLink will go well with 
images also. (so we're cool).

But I can't do that, 'cos I need the render attribute of the h:... elements.

Note:
- You always have to initialize your parameters to something.
- it seems updateModel is only called, if U're comparing against an 
  non-null model value.
  i.e. if the model value was null, updateModel is not called.
- that way, update model will always be called 
  (because it will see things as having changed).

To allow this, always insert 1 item into each row (ID 1),
and let that be reserved

Rather, the problem seems to be that,
- rendered attribute, when used with inputHidden, bombs
- so don't use rendered attribute on inputHidden

(done)

======

To show a topic
- for now, do not support pagination (like TSS)
- create your own tables (use forEach et al) ...

======

UserPreferences might not be necessary ... so let's not do it yet

======

================================================================

Search:

When you do a search
- search on topic title, or on whole topic posts, or on posts
  - index each post individually
  - index each topic altogether
  - index each topic 
    - store title, author
- show the following info on the page
  Topic, Topic Author, Forum, #Replies, #Views, Last Post date
- search for the thread (topic) which has the 

Search keys:
- poster
- title
- topic_content
- topic_last_post_date (upper and lower date bounds)

  - key will have:
       poster: val
       title:  val
       content: val
       date:    new Date(), new Date() (new Date[2])

When you index - for each document, store:
- author
- poster (many)
- contents of all posts
- content of all post titles
- topic_last_post_date 

Results are shown as a table with the following columns
-  Forum Path | Topic | Author | Answers | Views | Last Post | Score
   (kinda like view of topic.html)
 
====================

Preferences:
- We should store what topics folks subscribe to, in the database
- we should provide a listener interface
  and an implementation for Email ...
  This way, when someone subscribes to a topic, he/she gets an email.

CREATE TABLE phpbb_topics_watch (
  topic_id mediumint(8) UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
  user_id mediumint(8) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
)

A topic has X number of watchers
A user has X number of Topics he is watching
- so this is a bi-directional relationship

====================

Then, integrate your wiki in there 
  - have a single integration java file (making things lightweight).

=====================

Attachments:
- $uploaddir/users/username/$uploadedFile
- $uploaddir/net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/topic/$topicId/$attachment
  
  $uploaddir = .../$contextPath/$prefix/upload e.g. /oxyforum/p/upload ...

- have an macro for these
  
  {file:user|img=true|file=/}
  {file:topic|img=true|file=/}

===================

# We can't know when someone logs in, 'cos we may not control the login page
- Add a session listener which keeps track of number of open sessions

===================

StatisticsManager
- keeps track of number of views of topics
  - the event listener, listens for views of Topics, and increments the numViews
  - it has a timer thread, which runs every 5 minutes
    - it updates DB with topic views, and removes key from map
  
WatchManager
- event listener
- keeps track of Post Create events, and sends email to the notifiers

Events:
- Target - Object - (Forum, Topic, Post)
- Type   - int    - (Create, Read, Edit, Delete)


====================

Potential Features:
- http://www.jforum.net/posts/list/1470.page
- http://www.dynarch.com/projects/calendar/ (using the calendar)

=====================

Profile information:
- email
- yim 
- aim 
- msnm
- locale
- publicize_email
- attach_signature ( to posts?)
- avatar (any arbitrary url ...)
- signature

Show this profile information on the topic screen.

===================

incr user_posts when someone posts a message.

===================

Make actions to allow user upload files.
  - from user preferences action screen ...

Make actions to allow folks upload files to topic.
  - from viewtopic screen

show uploaded files to topic, on the UI ...
  - on viewtopic screen

show uploaded files of user on the UI ...
  - Name, Size, date

ForumViewAction     userprefsform.html  userprefsform
UserPrefsAction     -                   userprefs
UploadFileAction    -                   uploadfile

# UploadFileAction takes parameters like
  - upload.subpath  = users/$username OR net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/topic/$topicId
  - upload.nextview = userprefsform | topic

show the number of open sessions on the forum ...

====================

It seems that WebFileUpload is broken ... fix it ...
- on parseRequest, it always returns an empty list


Note that:
- attachments must not be put under the /p area
  - since that is handled by the forum servlet ...

Attachments go under $contextPath/upload
Other resources go under $contextPath/oxyforum/
======================

UserPreferences needs to be tested ...

======================

Have a way to index just since last time an index was done.
- A new action
- it figures out all topics which have their last post date after the 
  last index date, and re-indexes all those

To do this, we need a random table that store key-value.

oxyforum_misc_info
  - key(string) | value(string)
  e.g. last_index_datetime = 100004403323
  
(do not do this)
- we will add to the index each time a post is created (but not edited).

- So what we do, is incremental updates
  - every night, we will update the index
  - then search will find the latest updates
  - use a thread for this.

======================

U should allow
  - a post will have a parent post
  - at the top of a topic, the thread is shown, with hyperlinks to all the posts
  - each post has a permalink (which just shows it in isolation)
  - the posts are shown in chronological order 
  - U can link from a post to the position in the thread
  - U can link from the thread to the position of the details
  - 

To do this:
- there is a macro which can display a post
  - it takes indentLevel, Post
- Topic has a method called: getFirstPost
  - the firstPost never has a parent
  - all posts are children of either first post, or other posts
- Post has a method called:  getChildPosts(), getParentPost()
- 

==========================

Add the incremental index as a time based action

===========================

Add the ability to prune

===========================

Why is the numbers showing wrong??? e.g. for prune_days
- something with the mysql numbers

===========================

Figure out UI to lock/unlock a topic
- have a specific action for editing a topic
  - all it changes is the status
===========================

order by
  - type,
  - where status != LOCKED

show type in the listing ...

===========================

Ensure folks cannot post to a topic, if it is locked, or its forum is locked,
Ensure folks cannot create a new topic, it its forum is locked.

===========================

Special Styles:
- oxyforum-parentrow
- emulate the L&F of phpBB 
  - their styles and colors

Last post doesn't show???
(done)

===========================

Remember to call indexer, whenever U delete a topic

for indexing
- delete all at once
- reindex all at once

(done)
===========================

Let forms leverage the ForumConstants when they need to.
All constants they need are there.

=====================

Anonymous emails:
- we have an email address, and a random algorithm,
  to take an email address and get an anonymous one out of it.
  E.g. take a@b.com, convert to a-b@ugorji.com, ...

=====================

Templates:
- store template files in

TemplateHandler
- reads the ForumConfig
- gets the name of the template
- finds the files from net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/templates/$templateName

A templates files are stored in
  - WEB-INF/classes/net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/templates/$templateName/*.html
  - oxyforum/templates/$templateName/...
  
E.g. default template will use
  WEB-INF/classes/net.ugorji.oxygen/forum/templates/default/*.html
  oxyforum/templates/default/...

# U just have to specify the template name in the forum config.

====================

Subscribing | unsubscribing
  (allow user unsubscribe from topic)

========================

On the left of topic view, show (if defined):
- Name
- Avatar
- Joined when
- # posts
- Location

show website on the right ...

Joined: 03 Jul 2002
Posts: 4700
Location: Toronto, Canada

=====================

Userprefs (maintain the forum U were on)
(so add the id there)

=======================

handle viewing a topic
- when a topic is viewed, generate an event which is
  - Topic, READ
  (do this for all the processAction ones, and topic render one)

=======================

Add the listener which sends an email to all users watching a topic
(like the emails sent to us at work for tomcat)

Send the email to everyone at once.
- (later, change it to bcc everyone, and only send to a do-not-store mailbox)

=======================

Ensure website is in the userprofile

=========================

Let's allow the ability to default to a certain template location
- allow templates be found from a given place

=========================

Q: should sets in hibernate be loaded by default (ie have lazy=false???)
   it should all be lazy by default

=========================

change logic to do subscribe and unsubscribe
- let an entity represent the watch topics table
- be able to find it, and remove it easily

  dao.watchTopic(User u, Topic t, boolean yesorno)
  
   mysql.sql should have an id for topic watcher
   class for TopicWatch entity
   no-one calls getUsersWatching or getWatchedTopics (except the email guy)

=========================

does hibernate need all those 3rd party jars (asm, cglib, etc)
- or can it do without those ...

=========================

Put cancel buttons on all forms

=========================
Add this to the template

  - with some javascript, which basically says
    - take the form
    - change it's target
    - submit it


onClick='document.$formName.action="";document.$formName.submit();'

=========================

Clean up topic view UI:
- show the thread in a table
  Title Author Date/Time
- put a line in blue background at the top of a thread, which shows like those info (so the line is differentiating a new post) 
  oxyforum-post-metadata-top
  oxyforum-post-metadata-bottom
- do not alternate colors

======================

Security:
- no-one can post to a locked forum/topic
- etc etc etc

=================

Support quoting
- a quote parameter to the reply action.
- It will put the user's whole text in a blockquote ...
  ```   ```


=================

Create a user guide

=================

Ensure text is wiki-parseable before writing it
if error in parsing wiki, just type a "Text cannot be parsed" message

=================

figure out how to do the threaded tree, without so many queries
- maybe have one query which returns children sorted by parentpostid, postid??? (no ... its hard)
  - we'd 

=================

put an error page in there

=================

Put security, so users have to be in specific roles to do some actions
- admin role is defined in 
- manager role is defined: admin can do the following: edit, 

=================

Intl login.html and error.html files.

=================

user listing
- username | location | website | contacts (email, IM)

No concept of a moderator of a forum
- admin has full power

userprofile
- show #posts, location

admin of overall engine
- can do anything a moderator can do (and more)

moderator of a forum
- can lock/unlock the forum, or topics in it

how d'U know if a user is a moderator of a given forum???
- forum moderators table: 2 columns: user_id, forum_id

whatz the UI to set a user as a moderator
- on edit forum, there's a textfield to set moderators 
  (U just type the usernames)
- username must be unique in the DB

banning users is not supported at the forum/topic level
- so moderator cannot do it yet

recent topics
- change period is configurable
- show topics changed in last week (configurable)
- 

search is broken
- U should be able to search for topics changed recently

(recent topics link is a link to a search)

configure max search results number (done)

recent topics link is to:
- searchresults?TOPIC_LAST_POST_DATE.0=MM/dd/yyyy

(get recent topics date)

====================

You do not want to auto-link to yahoo, etc
- instead, just show a link to the user's profile, and a link to their email
- if they want anything else, they'd put it in their signature

email link is under the username

userprofile.html, userlist.html, topic.html
yahoo: , AOL: , MSNM: 

http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/search.dll?to=301398006
aim:goim?screenname=ayksupport&message=Hello+Are+you+there?

=====================

userprefs form should allow user set
- default topic view :
- show message thread

=====================

do input checking (to ensure that bad data does not go into the system)
- examine all forms which submit ...

=====================

Handle locked posts, topics, etc.
- U cannot post to a locked topic (reply, etc)
  - except U're in the admin role
  - postform, post
- U cannot post to a locked forum
  - except U're in the admin role

=================

BaseForumModel
- allowCreateTopic()
- allowPostToTopic()

=================

Recent Topics is broken

=====================

pagination (very important, especially as more and more topics get posted to the system)
- list of topics in a forum
- list of users in the db
  

=====================

when any of the userpref, etc are loaded,
- pass a subset of the properties object

======================

Preview on the postform screen
- call save() before saving
- add an edit link on the forum

Preview on postform screen
- use Ajax.update
- call an action which returns, in the body, the wiki markup (or the body or the contents of the error page)
- 

(this means, that the Ajax stuff, will be in the template)

======================

Seems wiki markup is not working for links (e.g. [a b | a/b]
- we need to correctly implement the do_link for the forum
- 
======================

Recalculate persisted statistics
--------------------------------
oxyforum_forum
  forum_posts mediumint(8)
  forum_topics mediumint(8)
  forum_last_post_id

oxyforum_user
  user_posts

Assume:
- Posts are never deleted if the Topic is still alive. 
  Instead, their content is changed to maybe an empty string.
- This means 
  - first post of a topic can never change,
  - last post of a topic can never disappear.

Forum
- make an action that will reset the collected report for the forum
- On pruning, we reset the statistics
- 
(done)
=================================

Have a config parameter, which says to run 
- "incremental index" at startup.
- recalculate statistics at startup.
(done)

=================================
Make a second template, only changing the topic.html
- this is called spartan
(done)

=================================
How to handle avatars
- U know what. We'd always show the image as 16*16.
- make a different view for the topic.html, which is very spartan-like.
  - like what is in digg.com

=================================
Have an action that just lists every forum.
- The first row shows |_ (and so on, but indented)
- There's no expand column
- A template can then decide on the action to show.

Either that, or:
- change the look of the forums.html page.
- It's really ugly'ish

=================================
Start writing help for the forum
- wiki format

==============

- When quoting, remove all tags which suggest a quote.
- Allow a quote to have a topic
  - e.g. Quote from 'user' on 'date' (while in forum)
Quote Macro should take a subject parameter
  - so that it can be at the top
(done)
